statsgod (1.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ported code to be statsd compatible so we can do a direct replacement
  * Some additional error logging / handling
  * Expose additional statistics for number of metrics/packets processed
  * Correct a few logic/concurrency errors
  * Removed sysV init and upstart conf -- these are not handled well by
    deb over different Ubuntu versions.  Handle this configuration elsewhere.
